# Running the Express Server in Development Mode

This repository contains an Express server implemented in JavaScript (ES module syntax) using the provided `server.mjs` file. This README provides instructions on how to execute the server using `npm run start:dev`.

## Prerequisites

Before running the server, ensure that you have the following installed:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the Express server:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   Change your current directory to the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the project dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Express server using the provided npm script:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

This command will run the server in development mode.

## Accessing the Server

By default, the server will start on port `3000`. You can access the server by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

## Usage

The server serves static files from the `CSS` and `images` directories. Additionally, it handles route requests for HTML files dynamically.

- Static CSS files can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/styles.css](http://localhost:3000/styles.css).
- Static image files can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/image.jpg](http://localhost:3000/image.jpg), where `image.jpg` is the name of the image file.
- HTML files can be accessed dynamically based on the route. For example, [http://localhost:3000/home](http://localhost:3000/home) will serve the `home.html` file.
